<h1 align="center">ABOUT IT<br><br></h1>
A universal roblox ui with over ?+ Options and mods for you to use in most roblox games this script uses RayField which is a singleton
so if your trying to use another script with it that also uses rayfield you cant sadly at least from my knowledge,
anyway the reason why i made this is so i can get familier with the lua lang, i code c# mostly so if u see some code you dont like or just-
ugly code in general expect it im a beginner.

Also something i also wanna say is **the reason why this is open sourced is because most of the code im using isnt mine or from devforms**
**and i dont feel like claiming code thats not mines**
